                            Octopus publications are not equivalent to journal articles or papers. Instead, there are 8
                            smaller publication types aligned with the publication process.

                                    publications are hierarchically linked in a collaborative chain, and each type needs
                                    to be linked to &apos;the one above it in the chain&apos;. This is designed to avoid
                                    vital missing links in the research record. For example, you can&apos;t publish an
                                    Analysis without linking it to the relevant Results, and you can&apos;t publish any
                                    Results without linking that to the Method that you followed. A Review (peer review)
                                    can, of course, be linked to any other type of publication; and a Research Problem
                                    can also arise from any other publication type. You can publish all stages of the
                                    chain (excluding a peer review of your own work!), but any author can also create a
                                    linked publication from another&apos;s work.

                                    the literature and history of the ideas as you can, giving credit to those who first

                                    Specialist materials cannot be hosted on Octopus, but the platform does allow you to

                                    for example, a video protocol, digital images or a large dataset in a specialist
                                    repository. In Octopus you should ensure that there is at least a descriptive

                                    sample data where relevant.

                                    authors need to approve a publication before it can go live. Authors will be asked
                                    to provide email addresses for each contributing author. They will receive an email
                                    asking them to confirm their involvement, and providing them with a link to the
                                    draft for review. Co-authors can then approve publication. If any amendments are
                                    required first, these should be raised directly with the submitting author.

                                    you use your funder&apos;s ROR identifier. This ensures that consistent, accurate
                                    organisational data is displayed and enables more efficient discovery and tracking
                                    of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies. However, if you funding
                                    source does not have a ROR, you can input its details manually. You can also provide
                                    a free-text statement describing the funding arrangements for your publication.

                                    There is no acceptance or rejection from Octopus – you are recording the work as
                                    yours, and registering when you did so. Others can then assess the work, review it,
                                    and build on it. You should therefore try to ensure that you are completely happy
                                    with the work before you press &apos;publish&apos;. As soon as the last co-author
                                    has agreed it, the work will be live and a DOI available.

                                    <span className="font-bold">What if I made a mistake?</span> Octopus will allow for
                                    reversioning of publications, but this feature is currently under development. When
                                    released, reversioning is intended for cases where an author makes a mistake, or a
                                    reviewer points out something which needs to be added or corrected. In the latter
                                    case, we strongly recommend including the reviewer as a co-author on a new version
                                    to recognise their input. All older versions remain visible on the record, but new
                                    versions have their own DOI. All reviews and red flags remain with the version they
                                    were originally linked to. We recommend keeping reversioning to a minimum.
