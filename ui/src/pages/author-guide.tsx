                    Octopus publications are different from traditional journal articles or papers. There are eight
                    smaller publication types aligned with the research process. A little like a &apos;patent
                    office&apos;, you can register all your work, including theories, data, and analyses. However, when
                    you start the publication process you’ll need to approach it as though you’re submitting to a
                    journal. Whatever you publish should be the formal &apos;version of record&apos;, ready to be
                    assessed by others and publicly recorded against your name and{' '}

                    All Octopus publications are hierarchically linked in a collaborative chain and need to be connected
                    to &apos;the one above it in the chain&apos;. This is designed to avoid vital missing links in the
                    research record. For example, you can&apos;t publish an ‘analysis’ without linking it to the
                    relevant ‘results’, and you can&apos;t publish any ‘results’ without linking that to the ‘method’
                    that you followed. A ‘peer review’ can be linked to any other type of publication; and a ‘research
                    problem’ can also arise from any other publication type. You can publish all stages of the chain
                    (excluding a peer review of your own work!), but any author can also create a linked publication
                    from another&apos;s work.

                    you’ll see the option to &apos;write a linked publication&apos; if you’re signed in. You can also

                and instead add them to the dedicated ‘References’ field. Octopus will review your references and
