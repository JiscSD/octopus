This should all make publishing regularly against a particular research project less time-consuming, and allows researchers to publish as they proceed through every stage.'

                    '<strong>Problem:</strong> Research outputs other than research articles (e.g. analytical code, data, videos, 3D object scans etc) are not being recognised as important outputs and hence researchers are not incentivised to produce them. Some parts of the research process are currently not being shared at all (e.g. full results disclosure, analytical code). Many researchers currently have ‘file drawers’ of small datasets, ideas they have not worked on further etc. which they have not published (because they are not incentivised to do so). This leads to waste of resources as other researchers are not being able to benefit from and build on this work. <br /> <br /> <strong>What Octopus is doing to help:</strong> Octopus encourages the publication of smaller pieces of work, which can be judged on their intrinsic qualities (e.g. how well thought-out the idea; how well-collected and reported the data), and not on whether they are currently part of a &apos;complete&apos; chain of research. This means that researchers are now incentivised to share all their best work, based only on its quality and not on its size or whether they&apos;ve carried on working it through to what is traditionally thought of as the &apos;conclusion&apos;. <br /> <br /> ‘Data’, ‘analysis’ and ‘real-life implementations’ are publication types of their own within Octopus, meaning that the sorts of outputs that often make up these parts of the research process would now be fully recognised on their own and incentivised. Digital-first (or indeed digital-only) publication also means that non-text elements are as simple to share as text. Outputs in other, specialist, repositories can be linked to Octopus publications directly and obviously. The hope is that this means that very varied research outputs will become standard and assessed in the same way as text currently is.'

There is also a bias towards positive, headline grabbing results rather than replications or &apos;negative results&apos;. However these have an immense value to the research community and the state of science. <br /> <br /><strong>What Octopus is doing to help:</strong> Octopus has no word limits, which allows publications to be as long as they need to be to share full details. <br /> <br /> Octopus allows authors to share and get recognition for reproducibility studies and negative results. The emphasis on Octopus is on high-quality outputs at every stage, not creating a particular narrative around the findings. <br /> <br /> In Octopus, every publication has to be linked to an existing one of ‘the type above it’ in the research chain, which means that parts of the research process cannot be missed out or not shared (e.g. someone cannot share data without linking it to the published methodology).'

Octopus removes editorial gatekeepers which means that there are no artificial barriers to publishing work - and what is incentivised are indicators of good quality/best practice in the research process, rather than any feature of the &apos;findings&apos; or &apos;impact&apos;.

Research not shared is often repeated or not learned from by others. <br /> <br /><strong>What Octopus is doing to help:</strong> On Octopus sharing work is quicker, easier, and carries no financial burden, reducing the &apos;publishing overhead&apos;. Those not in academia (i.e. practitioners and commercial researchers) and those with less access to funding are better able to share their work. This leads to less of a divide between academic and &apos;grey&apos; literature.'

In order to remove that pressure, Octopus no longer values research on the basis of the findings, but on the intrinsic quality of how it was done, and it also removes the narrative element from publications by breaking publications up into smaller pieces, so that hypotheses and data are no longer judged on how they relate to each other, but instead on the intrinsic qualities of each individually.

The publication of each &apos;piece&apos;, rather than trying to contribute whole pictures of one&apos;s own, should change the way that people see the research process, and behave within it. We hope that incentivising and positioning reviewing as a scientific skill like any other can help us set a good example and standard of what good, constructive critique looks like. <br /> <br /> Plus, once it&apos;s published in Octopus it is time-stamped and registered to the authors.

This can allow more specific recognition for individuals&apos; work and specialities. Over time, an author&apos;s Octopus profile page will build a picture of the kind of work they publish (e.g. they publish mainly hypotheses – they&apos;re an &apos;ideas person&apos;; or they publish mainly protocols – they&apos;re a &Apos;design person&apos;; or they publish mainly analyses etc).
