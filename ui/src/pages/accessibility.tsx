                    <h4 className="mt-6 font-semibold">User uploaded content</h4>
                    <p>
                        Whilst authors are provided with tools that allow them to create accessible publications, we do
                        not have any direct oversight of the content they upload, nor power to modify it. User uploaded
                        content on any publication page (at a URL beginning with https://www.octopus.ac/publications/)
                        may not conform with accessibility guidelines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Possible examples of non-accessible content include images without explanatory alt-text (1.1.1
                        Non-text content), relationships and information conveyed by shape, position and other
                        characteristics that cannot be conveyed to assistive technology (1.3.1 Info and relationships),
                        and links that do not provide context about their purpose (2.4.4 Link Purpose).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not within our power to compel users to upload accessible content, and we do not have any
                        form of manual intervention in the publishing process. As such, we believe that the time,
                        resources, and complexity of auditing each draft before publication to suggest modifications
                        represents a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We
                        will endeavour to provide features and guidance to authors to encourage them to upload
                        accessible publications.

                        must meet WCAG 2.1 A & AA guidelines. We&apos;re also committed to working on the issues above

                        Improvements are being made both as a part of routine development, and as dedicated exercises.
                        Accessibility is considered as a priority for all features developed for the platform.
