The start of any chain is a scientific Research Problem, from which can be linked a hypothesis/rationale, and from that a method/protocol, and so on.

You will need to explain what is known so far about the problem – rather like the ‘Introduction’ to a traditional paper.</p><p className='mb-2 font-bold'>Rationale/Hypothesis:</p><p className='mb-2'>A Rationale/Hypothesis publication sets out the theoretical basis for a potential solution, or partial solution, to the Research Problem it is linked to. In some fields a formal hypothesis is appropriate, and in some fields it will be more a description of an approach that might be taken.</p><p className='mb-2 font-bold'>Method:</p><p className='mb-2'>A Method publication describes in detail a way of testing a hypothesis, or carrying out a theoretical rationale. You can include links to sites such as protocols.io to give more detail of the method if that would be helpful to readers.</p><p className='mb-2 font-bold'>Results:<p><p className='mb-2'>A Results publication comprises raw data or summarised results collected according to an existing published Method. It should only describe the data or results themselves, without any analysis, along with details of the exact conditions under which the method was carried out – anything that might be needed for an analysis or interpretation of the results. You can include links to the raw data files.</p><p className='mb-2 font-bold'>Analysis:</p><p className='mb-2'>An Analysis publication describes manipulations of results to help conclusions be drawn from them. For example, thematic or statistical analysis.</p><p className='mb-2 font-bold'>Interpretation:<p><p className='mb-2'>An Interpretation publication describes conclusions drawn from an Analysis of results.</p><p className='mb-2 font-bold'>Real World Application:<p><p className='mb-2'>An Application publication describes how findings might have (or have had) an impact in the real world. This might be through a practical or policy application, and would be the appropriate publication type for Case Studies.<p><p className='mb-2 font-bold'>Peer Review:</p><p className='mb-2 '>Octopus Reviews are open and post-publication. A Review publication should be a carefully considered and constructive critique of an existing publication by someone else. Your review should help other readers assess the publication, and should be written in the same style as any other kind of publication (with relevant references).

A Rationale/Hypothesis directly following that will therefore no longer need to include all the information in that Research Problem, though may refer to other publications that support the scientific basis for the hypothesis. Similarly, publishing Results will no longer require you to write out the Method, merely link to the published Method you followed, and add only relevant specific details (such as the dates of data collection, batch numbers of reagents, model numbers of equipment etc).</p><p className='mb-2'>Where possible, references should include direct embedded permanent URLs (eg. DOIs).</p><p className='mb-2'>Similarly, funding statements and publication affiliations should use ROR identifiers to ensure that consistent, accurate organisational data is displayed. This also enables the more efficient discovery and tracking of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies.</p><p className='mb-2'>Acknowledgements should still be given at the end of a publication.</p><p className='mb-2'>For researchers whose fields already have reporting guidelines (such as the EQUATOR guidelines for the biomedical sciences), these should still be followed.</p><p className='mb-2'>You can format your own publications in the online editor within Octopus to be sure that you get it to look exactly as you want.
